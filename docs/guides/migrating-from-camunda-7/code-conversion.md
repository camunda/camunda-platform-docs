To run a soluion built for Camunda 7 on Camunda 8 you need to convert or refactor your code. We focus on Java code in this guide. This section will look into typical conversion patterns, and how to leverage tooling (namely [Open Rewrite](https://docs.openrewrite.org/)) to automate some of those patterns, before giving you an outlook how AI (think of GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT) can help you doing those refactoring.

## Pattern catalogue

Because of the flexibility of Camunda 7, users leveraged different ways to write code. Hence, there are many possible conversion patterns. Our approach to collect those is to use a collaborative GitHub repository, where our consultants, but also partners and users can add their own patterns to the catalgue. Still, you might adapt the patterns to your own situation, for example if you introduced own data handling or glue code abstractions.

You can find the pattern catalogue at [https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-7-to-8-code-conversion ](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-7-to-8-code-conversion).
