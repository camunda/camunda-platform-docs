The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.7.x to 8.8.x for each component.

## Removed deprecated OpenAPI objects

In previous releases we gradually transformed our entity keys from `number (int64)` to `string` types while still
providing users the opportunity to keep using the deprecated versions. However, with 8.8 release we removed the already
deprecated API objects containing number keys and with that, the additional content type headers, too.

If you already switched to `string` keys, then this change will not affect you in any way.

If you haven't updated yet, then now it's time.
You can read the details about this in the [overview about API Key Attributes][camunda8-api-overview].
