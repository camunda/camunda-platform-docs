title: Update 8.7 to 8.8
description: "Review which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.7.x to Camunda 8.8.0."
---

The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda 8.7.x to 8.8.x for each component.

## Prefix migration

:::warning
It is a requirement that Operate and Tasklist (for example, using `camunda.operate.elasticsearch.indexPrefix`) have
custom prefixes defined and that you are migrating to another non-empty prefix.
:::

### Migrating indices

:::warning
Disk usage will massively increase while the migration is ongoing.
Make sure you have at least double of disk space free.
:::

:::note
It is recommended that you first back up the Elasticsearch, and test the `migrate` script in a test environment first
to ensure there are no unexpected issues.
:::

1. Pause exporting for the 8.7 cluster while keeping Elasticsearch up. Replace `zeebe-gateway` with the actual host
   to the gateway.

```shell
curl -XPOST zeebe-gateway:9600/actuator/exporting/pause
```

2. In the `camunda/bin` directory there is a `prefix-migration` script that will execute the prefix migration,
   pass the desired prefix using the `CAMUNDA_DATABASE_INDEXPREFIX` environment variable.
3. Close the 8.7 cluster.

```shell
CAMUNDA_DATABASE_INDEXPREFIX=some-prefix ./prefix-migration
```

### Update to 8.8

With the migration finished, There are mandatory configuration changes to be made prior to updating to 8.7.

:::note
Without these configuration changes the update to 8.8 will fail.
:::

Given a new desired prefix of `some-prefix`

- The configured `CAMUNDA_OPERATE_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_PREFIX` must now be `some-prefix`.
- The configured `CAMUNDA_TASKLIST_ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX_PREFIX` must now be `some-prefix`.
- The prefix for the [Camunda exporter](/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/exporters/camunda-exporter.md) should be configured using `ZEEBE_BROKER_EXPORTERS_CAMUNDA_ARGS_INDEX_PREFIX` to `some-prefix`.
